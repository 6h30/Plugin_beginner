- [Narrator] Many commands in Revit start with a prompt to the user to select a single element, multiple elements, or part of a particular element such as its face. The OI document allows us to access user interface functionality including the ability to select elements in the project. So, now that we have the UI document in our command let's use that to select an element from the project. In the command we have created, let's use the UI document to retrieve a selected element from the Revit document. To do that we need to use a method called pickObject from the selection class that can be retrieved from the UI document object. This will return a reference element from the Revit API. A reference element from the Revit API is simply a stable reference to a geometric object in Revit. So, let's create a reference variable named PickObj and we'll do this after we've retrieved the UI document. We can then assign to this the result of the pickObject method. To access this, let's access the UI document (typing) and then the selection class and pickObject method. As you can see from the description, this prompts the user to select an element and it takes an enumeration as the parameter which is the object type. So, let's add that in and the enumeration. And here are all the different parts we could select. For now let's select element as we want to be able to select any Revit element. (typing) Great! So, our command will now prompt the user to select an element. Let's add the code to display the element ID back to the user. Before we can do, however, let's catch if the user has actually selected an element as this is good practice when writing commands, or any code for that matter as this might cause an error if there isn't a reference stored under the pickObject variable for whatever reason. (typing) So, let's add an "if statement" and we'll check if pickObj does not equal null. And if this is not equal to null, let's display a taskDialog. A taskDialog is basically a dialog window from the Revit API and it allows us to
