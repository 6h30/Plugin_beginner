1-8-Selecting elements
- [Narrator] Many commands in Revit start with a prompt to the user to select a single element, multiple elements, or part of a particular element such as its face. The OI document allows us to access user interface functionality including the ability to select elements in the project. So, now that we have the UI document in our command let's use that to select an element from the project. In the command we have created, let's use the UI document to retrieve a selected element from the Revit document. To do that we need to use a method called pickObject from the selection class that can be retrieved from the UI document object. This will return a reference element from the Revit API. A reference element from the Revit API is simply a stable reference to a geometric object in Revit. So, let's create a reference variable named PickObj and we'll do this after we've retrieved the UI document. We can then assign to this the result of the pickObject method. To access this, let's access the UI document (typing) and then the selection class and pickObject method. As you can see from the description, this prompts the user to select an element and it takes an enumeration as the parameter which is the object type. So, let's add that in and the enumeration. And here are all the different parts we could select. For now let's select element as we want to be able to select any Revit element. (typing) Great! So, our command will now prompt the user to select an element. Let's add the code to display the element ID back to the user. Before we can do, however, let's catch if the user has actually selected an element as this is good practice when writing commands, or any code for that matter as this might cause an error if there isn't a reference stored under the pickObject variable for whatever reason. (typing) So, let's add an "if statement" and we'll check if pickObj does not equal null. And if this is not equal to null, let's display a taskDialog. A taskDialog is basically a dialog window from the Revit API and it allows us to display information and receive simple information from the user. By using this taskDialog from the Revit API, it will ensure that it looks like all other Revit dialogs. To create a dialog we simply access the show method from the task dialog class found in the Revit.ui namespace. So, let's add taskDialog.show and this isn't overloaded method, meaning that there are a few different versions that we could use depending on the parameters we provide. Let's use the most basic one, which simply takes a title string and an instruction string. For the title let's add in element id and for the message let's retrieve the id from the element we selected. To do that we can access the element id property directly from the reference object. So, let's add pickedObject.elementid and as the element id is an object in itself we need to retrieve it as a string. So, let's add the two string method. Perfect So, this should work as planned. There's one more error we want to catch, however, and that is if someone escapes out of the command. We want to ensure that this doesn't show an unexpected error. To account for that, we can wrap our command in a tri-catch statement to catch any error such as escaping out of the command. So, let's add tri at the beginning of our function and we want to ensure that all of the code after this is contained inside of the tri statement so I've used copy/paste to place it inside. Then after the tri statement, let's add a catch statement which takes the exception as the parameter with the variable e. So, within this catch statement, let's retrieve the message from the exception. This is where we can use the string object that was passed into the command as a parameter. Revit will display any string we assigned to this message parameter. So, let's assign the message property from the exception to this message string. And then return the result failed as the command failed. Perfect within our command we have accessed the UI document object from the Revit project then selected an element and displayed that element id back to the user. What we need to do next is build our command and load it into Revit.
