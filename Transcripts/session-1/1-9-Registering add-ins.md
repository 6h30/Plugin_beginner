- [Instructor] So far in the course, we've successfully coded our first Revit plugin command. What we need to now is load it into Revit. In order to do that, we need to register the command for it to show up in Revit. And we do this by creating what's known as a manifest file. When Revit boots up, it will rate the manifest files located in one of two specific file locations in order to determine what plugins to load and with what options. Let's have a look at adding a manifest file into our project. To add a manifest file, right-click the project name and select add new item. Here we can select new items to add to our project. Let's select application manifest file. And the first thing we'll need to do is rename the file to match the name of our plugin so that Revit knows which manifest file to look inside. So let's rename this to myrevitcommands and the extension we need for this file is .addin, as this is the type of file that Revit will look for. And then go ahead and click add. Great, so that's created the file although currently it's populated with a lot of code we don't need. So let's select all of that and hit delete. Then let's add in the code needed for our Revit add-in. Autodesk provides templates for command add-in files, which you can find on the Autodesk Revit Developer Guide online. However, I've gone ahead and copied this into a txt file, which you can find in the start exercise folder for this video. So once you have the myrevitcommnands.txt file open, go ahead and select all the text and hit Control + Save for copy, and then Control + V for paste inside of our add-in. As you can see, the add-in file is not C#, but it's written in XML, a markup language. This is used to create settings for our add-in when it's loaded. Each of the names of the settings is shown between the angle brackets. For example, name, assembly, or description. The value for these settings then go in between the two tags.
