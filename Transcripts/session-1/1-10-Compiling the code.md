- [Instructor] We've now created an Add-in file to tell Revit how to load our new plugin. All we need to do next is compile the code and run the .dll, or dynamic link library file that results. A DLL file is basically all of our code compiled into a single file, containing code and data that can be run by other applications. In our case, Revit. So in this video, we'll compile our code and set it to copy to the required location so we can execute and debug our command. When we build our solution, it will result in a DLL file being output. So let's try this and see what happens. In the Build menu at the top, let's select Build Solution. Great. So the output window at the bottom of the screen displays the output from the build. And, in this case, it was a success. As it says Build 1 succeeded. If there was anything wrong with our code, Visual Studio would be sure to tell us about it in this window. And the output would fail. So it's important to check this log if anything goes wrong. You will notice the folder that our solution is compiled into. Let's go ahead and have a look at this folder to see what the contents are. Here you will find three files that our code has produced. The files are the DLL file, our Add-in file, and a file with the extension pdb. Which is short for program database file. This is used when debugging code. Which we'll use in the next video. In order for Revit to read this code, and execute what it contains, it needs to be stored in an Add-in folder. Which Revit will check the contents of every time that it's booted up. This can be one of two different locations. The first is found in ProgramData, Autodesk, Revit, Addins, and 2019. And this tends to store non-user specific files, or plugins. The alternative is found in Users, Username, AppData, Roaming, Autodesk, Revit, Addins, and 2019. And this is unique to the user on the computer. As this is unique to my user account, I'll be using it to store the compiled files. Revit checks this folder each time that it boots up. And reads any of the manifest files included. Then, based on the manifest file, execute the require DLL file. We could just copy our compiled files into this folder and our command would run as expected. This is a very manual process, however. And if we're going to be testing lots of commands through the course, we want to make it a little bit more automated. So to automate the process of putting our compiled files into this folder, we can do so with a build event in Visual Studio. Inside Visual Studio, go to the Project menu at the top. And then, MyRevitCommands Properties. This is where we can adjust settings for our project. In the Build Events tab on the left, we can add pre- and post-build event marks of commands. Which will allow us to copy and paste compiled files into the Add-in folder. Let's do that by selecting Edit Post-build. Which will allow us to construct a command. We can construct the Macro as we would write it in the terminal command line. So to copy, we start with the word copy. We then need to write the path of the file to copy from, in quotation marks. So let's add two quotation marks. Inside of here, we'll add the file path. A quick way of doing this is using the Macros. Inside of here, we can find a Macro called TargetDir. This is the file path that our code is being compiled into. So let's insert that into the quotation marks. And then to ensure that all of the contents of that file are copied, we end the target directory with quotation mark dot quotation mark. So all files will be copied. Next, we need to add in the file path to add to. And this needs to be in another set of quotation marks. So let's add space and double quotation marks. The file path that I'm going to use is the local file path. To get the Roaming file in the user account we can use the shortcut AppData. Unfortunately, this isn't in the Macros menu. So let's simply add dollar sign, round bracket, AppData, and then, close round bracket. So this will take us directly to the Roaming file. And if you recall, the end of the file path is \Autodesk, \Revit, \Addins, \2019. Great. So that's it. And then end it with backslash. Great. So that's all we need. When we compile our code now, the files will be directly copied into that folder. Let's give it a try by hitting OK. And then, selecting Build Solution again. And you can see in the output window, that all of our three files have been copied over.
