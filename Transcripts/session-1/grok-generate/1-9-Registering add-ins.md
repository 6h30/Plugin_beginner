1-9-Registering add-ins
- [Instructor] So far in the course, we've successfully coded our first Revit plugin command. What we need to now is load it into Revit. In order to do that, we need to register the command for it to show up in Revit. And we do this by creating what's known as a manifest file. When Revit boots up, it will rate the manifest files located in one of two specific file locations in order to determine what plugins to load and with what options. Let's have a look at adding a manifest file into our project. To add a manifest file, right-click the project name and select add new item. Here we can select new items to add to our project. Let's select application manifest file. And the first thing we'll need to do is rename the file to match the name of our plugin so that Revit knows which manifest file to look inside. So let's rename this to myrevitcommands and the extension we need for this file is .addin, as this is the type of file that Revit will look for. And then go ahead and click add. Great, so that's created the file although currently it's populated with a lot of code we don't need. So let's select all of that and hit delete. Then let's add in the code needed for our Revit add-in. Autodesk provides templates for command add-in files, which you can find on the Autodesk Revit Developer Guide online. However, I've gone ahead and copied this into a txt file, which you can find in the start exercise folder for this video. So once you have the myrevitcommnands.txt file open, go ahead and select all the text and hit Control + Save for copy, and then Control + V for paste inside of our add-in. As you can see, the add-in file is not C#, but it's written in XML, a markup language. This is used to create settings for our add-in when it's loaded. Each of the names of the settings is shown between the angle brackets. For example, name, assembly, or description. The value for these settings then go in between the two tags. So name, for example, has two name tags with the value, myrevitcommands. Some of the essential settings are the name of the plugin, this case, myrevitcommands, the assembly full path, this is the location of our compiled dll file, and it includes the extension .dll. As we'll be saving the file directly in the add-ins folder, we only need to specify the file name, not the path. Next we need to include and ID for our add-in in between the add-in ID tags. This is in the form of a GUID, or global unique identifier, which needs to be unique for each command. The associator has functionality to generate GUIDs for us. Let's use this feature to generate a new GUID for this command. To do this, go to the tools manual at the top, and then, create GUID. This will bring up the create GUID window which we can use to generate different GUIDs. We just need the GUID itself with no formatting. So for the options, let's select the last and then click new GUID, and copy, so that it's copied to our clipboard, so we can now exit the window, and let's paste it in between the add-in tags. This comes with some excess formatting which we don't need, so let's remove the angle brackets, the ram brackets and the quotation marks on both sides. Perfect! So there's that GUID. The full class name tag indicates the name space and class name that our command resides in. In our case, our command is the getillumid class, inside of the myrevitcommands name space. This is so Revit knows which class is the entry point for the command. Tags such as text and description are optional. These are the name of the command in Revit, and the description when hovering over them, so they're quite useful to add. Vendor ID is required and this is unique. In my case, it's Jeremy, but you can change this. The description is optional. And the visibility mode indicates when the command is visible, such as always visible. Let's change this to not visible when no active document, as we don't want the command showing when it's not usable. To do this, simply replace always visible with not visible when no active document, ensuring that each word is capitalized with no spaces. These aren't the only tags that we can add to the manifest file. In the online developer documents, you'll find a description of all the tags to add. For now, let's stick with these ones. Now that we've created the add-in file, what we need to do is make sure that it copies to the output file when we compile our code. So let's change the properties of the file to copy to the output file. To do that, select the add-in file in the solution explorer, and the properties on the bottom right in the copy to output directory, let's change this to copy if new. Perfect! Now we just need to build our code and test if it's working properly.
