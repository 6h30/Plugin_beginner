The IExternalCommand
- [Instructor] To create our first Revit plug-in command, we're creating what is called an external command. External commands are essentially exposed objects that implement the IExternal Command interface. They, in turn, become commands in Revit that can access the Revit database and selected elements. If you haven't heard the term interface before, this is a type in Csharp that contains related members such as methods and properties that can be implemented by a class or strut. When we compile our code into a DLL or dynamic link library, Revit will rate this DLL and any IExternal command classes we create, will be added on to the Revit interface under the add-ins tab to then be executed. Provided it utilizes the IExternal command interface correctly. And it is described in a manifest file, which we'll learn about later. The IExternal command interface has one method, execute. Which needs to be defined in the command class. This will run when the command is pressed in Revit. When a command is run, a command object is created and it's execute method is called. After the command has finished running, the command object is then destroyed. The execute method requires three parameters to run in Revit. And these parameters are delivered to the function by Revit When the command is run. These are an external command data object from the Revit API which contains reference to the Revit application and view required by the external command. We can therefore access all the Revit data through this object. Secondly, it takes a reference to a string object. This can be used to relay a message back to the user, if the command fails or it's canceled. If the command is canceled or fails, and the string parameter has been set in our command, this will be returned to the user as a message. If it is not set, then the command will simply exit. Thirdly, it takes an element set object from the Revit API, which is initially empty. And can be used to display elements back to the user. If the command fails and elements have been added to the elements set in our command, these will be highlighted back to the user. Now execute method does not necessarily need to make use of the string and element set parameters. However these are useful for relaying information back to the user. Finally to successfully implement the execute method, we need to return a result. This is a type of numeration, which is either succeeded, canceled or failed. Succeeded means the command executed successfully. Canceled means the user canceled the command and any string set to the input string parameter will be sent back to the user. And failed means there will be an unhandled error in the command. And any string and element set set to the input parameters will be returned back to the user. The best way to learn about Iexternal commands is to create on. So let's do that in our command.
