1-6-Creating a command
- [Speaker] Now that we understand what an I external command is. Let's use this class to create a command in our project file. I'm continuing on where we left off in video four of this section. If you don't have it opened, you can find it in the exercise folder for this video. The command that we'll be creating will allow us to select an element and retrieve its element ID. So let's start by renaming the class we made in the previous video so that it would describe the command that it's going to perform. In the solution explorer on the right, we can rename the class by right clicking the object and clicking rename. I'm going to call mine, get element ID. And hit enter. And then as we want to update all references to class one, I'm going to click yes. Great, so let's start by implementing the I external command interface. To do that, we simply add a colon after our class name and then the interface which is I external command. You can see that it's popped up in the IntelliSense. This is because we have already referenced it into our class. And in the top you can see, using auto desktop Revit dot UY is now highlighted. You'll also notice that the I external command has a squiggly red line which means that there is something wrong with our code. If we hover over the word, we can see the error that has occurred which is that the execute method has not been implemented yet. So let's go ahead and do that. We can do this quickly in visual studio by clicking the drop down on the little light bulb which has popped up. This gives us options to correct the error. Let's click implement interface as that's exactly what we want to do. By implementing the interface, it means all the methods and properties required by the interface is populated in our class. Perfect. So now we have the execute method. If you recall earlier, this takes three parameters. The first is that external command data which is stored under the command data variable. Next, is a reference to a string object with the variable message. Ref simply means it is a reference so it can be modified in the method. Lastly, it requires an element set object from the Revit dot debut name space which is stored under the variable elements. At the moment, our method is simply throwing an exception. As we learn in the last video, we need to return a result. So let's fix that by first removing the exception. And replace it with a return result. And as this is an enumeration, let's add dot and then select succeeded. You can see that there are three options: failed, canceled and succeeded. We can return each of these separately depending on what happens in our command. We will experiment more with this later on in the course. Perfect. So we now have our first command. There is one last thing we need to add to make this a working command and that is to add a transaction attribute. This goes in square brackets on the line before the class is declared. And is added by adding the word transaction attribute, squared brackets and then the enumeration transaction mode dot read only. This attribute will tell Revit how the command will use transactions, whether it is manual or automatic. We'll learn about transactions later on in the course. For now, all we need to understand is that the transaction attribute is required on all implementations of the art central command interface. Nice work. We've successfully implemented our first command in our Revit project file. At the moment though, it isn't really doing much. So next let's look at adding some useful code into our command.
