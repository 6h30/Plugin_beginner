1-6-Creating a command

- [Speaker] Now that we understand what an I external command is. Let's use this class to create a command in our project file. I'm continuing on where we left off in video four of this section. If you don't have it opened, you can find it in the exercise folder for this video. The command that we'll be creating will allow us to select an element and retrieve its element ID. So let's start by renaming the class we made in the previous video so that it would describe the command that it's going to perform. In the solution explorer on the right, we can rename the class by right clicking the object and clicking rename. I'm going to call mine, get element ID. And hit enter. And then as we want to update all references to class one, I'm going to click yes. Great, so let's start by implementing the I external command interface. To do that, we simply add a colon after our class name and then the interface which is I external command. You can see that it's popped up in the IntelliSense. This is because we have already referenced it into our class. And in the top you can see, using auto desktop Revit dot UY is now highlighted. You'll also notice that the I external command has a squiggly red line which means that there is something wrong with our code. If we hover over the word, we can see the error that has occurred which is that the execute method has not been implemented yet. So let's go ahead and do that. We can do this quickly in visual studio by clicking the drop down on the little light bulb which has popped up. This gives us options to correct the error. Let's click implement interface as that's exactly what we want to do. By implementing the interface, it means all the methods and properties required by the interface is populated in our class. Perfect. So now we have the execute method. If you recall earlier, this takes three parameters. The first is that external command data which is stored under the command data variable. Next, is a reference to a string object with the variable message. Ref simply means it is a reference so it can be modified in the method. Lastly, it requires an element set object from the Revit dot debut name space which is stored under the variable elements. At the moment, our method is simply throwing an exception. As we learn in the last video, we need to return a result. So let's fix that by first removing the exception. And replace it with a return result. And as this is an enumeration,
