1-7-Accessing the application
- When accessing Revit via the API, we can do so through the application, which is essentially the Revit session that we're working in, or through the document, which represents a Revit project file that we're working in. This is done through four different objects: the application, the UIApplication, the document, and the UIDocument. An application object provides access to application-wide settings such as project location settings, language, and application events. We'll learn more about this later on. The UIApplication object provides access to the interface or the ribbon and UI properties. We can use this to add custom ribbon items for example, which we'll also learn about later on in the course. The document object refers to the Revit project file that we're working in, so it provides access to all the elements, views and data within a model. We'll use this throughout the course. Finally the UI document provides access to the project-level user interface methods and properties, such as refreshing the view, getting selected elements, or prompting the user to select an element. This is what we need to access in our new command to promptly use it to select an element from which we can then retrieve the element ID. So let's jump into visual studio and add that into our command. Where we left off in the last video is with a command that's simply returning a result. So let's add in the UI document, so that we can later on select elements from our command. To access the UI document in our class, we can do so via the external command data, which is passed to the command when it is executed. So we can access this through the command data variable. Before the result is returned, let's retrieve the UI document from the project file. To do that, let's simply create a UIDoc variable which is a type of UI document, and then we'll assign to that the UI document for the project that we run the command in. So let's access the command data variable and from the external command data object we can access the application property. This returns a UI application which can then be used to retrieve the active UI document by accessing the active UIDocument property. Pefect. We now have the UIDocument referenced into our command. We can use this to start accessing the methods and properties of the project-level user interface.
