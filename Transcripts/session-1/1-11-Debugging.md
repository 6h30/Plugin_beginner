- [Instructor] We have learned how to automatically compile our command, and copy the files into the required directory. We can also automatically launch Revit from within Visual Studio too and test our command. To do this, we need to run the solution in debug mode. This will allow us to test our command and investigate any bugs that it might contain. To test the command, we need to tell Visual Studio to run Revit once debug mode is started. To do this, go to the debug menu at the top, and then, properties at the bottom. And this is where we can add Revit. To do that, we need to tell Visual Studio what .exe file to run; that is Revit.exe. To add this, click the Start external program option, and then Browse. Navigate to where you have Revit installed. On my machine, this is in C:, Program Files, Autodesk, Revit 2019. And in here, we can find Revit.exe. Go ahead and click Open to add that in. So now we can test our command directly from Visual Studio. Let's try that by going up to the play symbol at the top, and clicking Start. And the first thing we get is this window pop-up which you may have seen in Revit before. This happens when Revit is loading an unregistered add-in. That is, it does not have a trusted certificate associated with it. Getting the required certificate is beyond the scope of this course. However, we don't really need it as we're not planning to distribute this plug-in. So, for now, let's just click Always Load, so that the plug-in is always loaded. To test the command, let's create a new project by clicking New. and I'm going to select the Architectural Template. We can find our new command in the Add-Ins tab at the top, and then at the left, External Tools. And this drop down here is our command: GetElementID. You can see the name and description associated with it. Let's give it a whirl. Go ahead and select the command. And select an element. Awesome. So you can see our new command is working perfectly. A new window has popped up with the element ID details. You can also test the try/catch statements which were created to catch when someone exits out of the command. So, let's try the command again. And hit escape for Cancel. And there's the message. "The user aborted the pick operation." Debugging mode lets us look at what is going on under the hood while our code is running. So, let's stop this session by switching back to Visual Studio and pressing the red square at the top for stop debugging. Then in our class, let's add a breakpoint to our code. This allows us to check what's happening at a specific line of code while our code is running. To do that, let's add one in at line 27. On the left of the number of the line, in the gray column, click the left mouse button. And you can see a break-point has been added with the red circle. So now, when we debug our code, when this line of code is executed, Visual Studio will step into the code and check all of the current variables. Let's try that by starting the debugger again. And create a new project. And run the command again. Great, so you can see that it's taken us back to our code. And in the auto window in the bottom, you can see all the current variables and associated data. So currently, the pick object variable is drawing a reference object and if we click the little triangle on the left, we can expand the reference object and look at all of its properties and associated values. This is incredibly useful if our code starts to do unexpected things. We can also step into and through our code line by line and watch what the data does. To do this, click the little down pointing blue arrow at the top, which lets us step into. And you can see the data at the bottom updated. Keep these tools in mind when creating plug-ins, as they are extremely useful when finding inevitable bugs. By stepping through the code line by line, we can check how variables and data is changing. If we want to continue the command and step out of debugging mode, we simply click Continue at the top.
