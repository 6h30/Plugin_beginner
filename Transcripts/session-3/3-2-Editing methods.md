Editing methods
- [Instructor] The Revit API offers a few different ways to edit elements. One of the primary ways is using the element 'transform utools class'. In the object browser, let's go ahead and have a look at this class by searching for element > transform > uTools. In this class, there are a variety of different static methods that allow us to edit elements in different ways such as moving, rotating or copying. These can operate on either a single element or multiple elements based on the parameters we provide. So let's try out a couple of different ones such as moving and rotating an element and we'll do this in a new command. In the visual studio exercise file for this video, I've already set up the command and I've named this 'edit element'. This is an I external command and much like our last commands, it allows the user to select an object, retrieves the element and then I've set off a transaction called 'edit elements'. In here, let's move and rotate an element- one after the other. Let's start by moving the element. If we have a look at the move element method in the element transform Utools class, we can see that it takes three different parameters: a document, an element ID and a translation. We already have the document and the selected element ID, we just need the translation vector. As we learned earlier, this is defined by an XYZ object, which is the same for a point. It can also be used as a vector as it can be read as the end point of a vector. For example, let's create a new XYZ variable named 'MoveVec' and we'll do this before the call to move element. And we'll assign to this a new XYZ with the parameters three for X, three for Y, and zero for Zed. This defines a vector from the origin at 000 to the point 330, which means three units in the X direction and three units in the Y direction. Therefore, the XYZ is defining a vector. That is, a direction and a length in space. So let's use that in the move element method. First we need the document, the element ID which is LEID in this case, and MoveVec. Great. So that's all we need to move an element. Let's now try rotating an element. To do this, let's look at the rotate element method in the element transform Utools class. For this method we need the document again, the element ID and this time a line for the axis to rotate around and the angle to rotate in radiants. We can form the axis to rotate around by creating a line in the Zed axis. We can do this from the selected element location point. So let's start by retrieving the location point from the element location property and we'll use the variable location. Making sure to do this before the rotate element method. And we want it as a location point so let's cast as location point. Then let's retrieve the point from this location point object and we'll assign it to the XYZ variable named p1. We can now use that point to create another point directly up in the Zed axis. So let's create another XYZ object named P2 and this will be a new XYZ using the X property from the p1 point. The Y property from the p1 point and the Zed property from the p1 point plus ten units. So with these two points we can create a line using the create bound method from the line class. Let's create a line variable named 'axis'. We'll assign to that a call to the create bound method using p1 and p2 as the parameters. Great, so we have our axis to rotate around. Let's create a rotation angle, which will be a double named angle. The angle will need to in radiants but to make it easier, let's convert 30 degrees to radiants by multiplying 30 by pi, which we can access from the math namespace, divided by 180. This is the formula to convert radiants to degrees. So now that we have all the ingredients, let's add those in to the rotate element method. First we need the doc, the element ID to rotate, the axis to rotate around and the angle. Perfect. So this command will allow us to select a point based element which it will then move and rotate. I've already added this into the manifest, so let's go ahead and hit debug. Then open up the Revit exercise file for this video and let's try our command on the piece of furniture that's in the project. So this should move the element then rotate it. Perfect. It's moved it three units in the x-axis, three units in the y-axis and then rotated it. Now there are many times in the Revit API that this is useful for automatically editing elements. Keep in mind that it's always important to ensure the element can handle it. For example, the element 'transform Utools class', provides a method, 'can mirror element' to check if an element can be mirrored. By checking this first, we can catch areas that may occur.
