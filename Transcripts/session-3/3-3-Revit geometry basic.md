Revit geometry basics
- [Instructor] So far in this course we have used a few different geometry types that the Revit Api offers, such as a XYZ object, lines, and arcs. Let's take a closer look at some of the other geometry types in the Revit Api, by looking at the geometry that makes up different elements. The geometric model of a Revit 3D element is defined by a geometry element object, which is a geometric representation of an element. This object can be retrieved from an element and acts like a list containing other geometry types that make up Revit elements. These different geometry types include solids, meshes, geometry instances, curves, points, and polylines. Some of these can be further broken down. Solid objects are made up of faces and edges, and the geometry instance can contain all other geometry types, or nested geometry instances. The geometry instance, therefore, can be nested several times. A geometry instance is a piece of geometry that represents a stored set of geometry, commonly used for family instances, like a door for example. This will be made up of different geometric elements, such as a frame, panel, and handle. To retrieve geometry from the element, we need to retrieve the geometry element object from the element. We can then traverse, or loop over the geometry element, like a list. Objects that are retrieved from the geometry element, are geometry objects. This is the base class for geometry in Revit. So, we can then cast this object to it's appropriate type. Whether it is a face, mesh, or geometry instance. If we receive a geometry instance, we need to use the get instance method from the geometry instance object to retrieve it's associated geometry element. We then need to loop through it's contents again. So, let's jump over to the object browser in Visual Studio to look at how to retrieve the geometry element. Go ahead and search for element. We can access an element's geometry by retrieving it through the geometry property on the object. This property is overloaded, as it takes a parameter which means we'll need to prefix the property with get underscore when we retrieve it. We can see this contained in the methods of the element class. For the parameter, the geometry property requires an options object to be supplied. This let's us customize the output that we receive. Let's select the option class to take a look. Easy. We can create an option object using the constructor. And the options we can set are shown in the properties. Compute references needs to be set to true through retrieve reference objects, from the element geometry. These referenced objects are required by some Revit Api methods, such as dimensioning. Detail view is an enumeration type of coarse, medium, and fine. This determines the quality of geometry retrieved. That is, fine means higher quality, or more faces. Include non-visible objects can be used to retrieve hidden element geometry. And, view can be set to determine the view in which the geometry is extracted, as some my be clipped. Once geometry is extracted from the element, it can be used in a variety of different functions, such as, computing for location in relation to others, using it to define other elements, and to find out it's properties, such as areas and lengths.
