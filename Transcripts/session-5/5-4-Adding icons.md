Adding icons

- [Instructor] With our own ribbon tab in the Revit user interface, we can add as many commands as we like and customize them in different ways. One such way is by adding our own icons to the commands to make them a little bit easier to identify. So in this video, let's have a look at adding an icon to the command that we just added to our new tab. To start, we'll need an image to use as our button image. The ideal size for button images in the UI is 32 by 32 pixels. However, some smaller controllers, such as drop downs are ideally 16 by 16. As you can see in the exercise folder for this video, I've gone ahead and saved a 32 by 32 sized .PNG file named desk. If you want to do this with another image, try creating it as a bigger format, say 200 by 200 pixels in vector software, such as Illustrator, and then scaling it down. In the external application where we created our tab and button, let's add the code in here to add the image to the button. To do that, we first need access to the properties of the button. On line 28 where we added the button, we'll need to amend this so that we can access the button after it's been added. To do that, let's amend this line, and we'll add in push button, which will be a new push button variable named, pushButton. And you can see that this add item method returns a ribbon item. The push button class inherits this. So let's try to cast it as that type by adding in as PushButton. Great, so now we can access the push button data. So pushButton.LargerImage allows us to get and set the icon which is used for that button. For this though, we'll need an image source object, such as a bitmap image. And this is found in the presentation core assembly. So let's right-click References and go to Add Reference, and then in the Assemblies tab search for presentation core. Let's select that by ticking the check box, and hitting OK. Great, so now we can see the image source object is within the System.Windows.Media namespace. The bitmap image class inherits from the image source class, and this will allow us to load our image as a URI, or uniform resource identifier, which can be used to locate our image. So before the push button is created, let's add in the code to retrieve our image. Start by creating a URI variable named imagePath, and we'll assign to this a new URI, which will take the file path as a parameter. So you go to the location that you've saved the image, use CTRL + C to copy it, and then CTRL + V to copy it into the parameter. As it needs to be a string, let's surround it with quotation marks. And then before the string, let's add the @ symbol so that the backslashes aren't read as escapes. And at the end of this line, let's add in \desk.png. Now using this URI, we can create a bitmap image object. To do that, let's create a bitmap image variable named image and currently it's not finding that class because we need to add in the namespace to our class. So clicking the light bulb, let's add in the namespace System.Windows.Media.Imaging. Great, so that's now referenced into our class. Next let's assign to the image variable a new bitmap image using imagePath as the parameter. Finally, we can now assign this bitmap image to the large image property on the button. So let's add in = image. Great, we've now added the image to our button. Let's go ahead and hit Start to debug it. Open up the Revit exercise file for this video, and then let's head to our new tab. Perfect, so you can see that our command now has its very own icon. As you can imagine, this makes displaying our commands a lot easier and dynamic. There are also many different types of ways to display buttons, whether it be by drop down, radio button, or list box of buttons. If you want to learn more about these, try having a look at the Interface Guidelines shown in the Revit Developer Guideline pages.
