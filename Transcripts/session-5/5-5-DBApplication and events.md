DBApplication and events
- [Instructor] The last type of adding we can create using the Revit API is by utilizing the IexternalDB application interface. This type of application add-in does not access the user interface, but is used to assign to events in the Revit session. So in this video, let's create an application that assigns to any changes that occur to specific element types. So let's start by creating a new class, which will be our IexternalDB application. You can do that by right clicking the solution name, selecting add and new item. Then in the visual C# items, make sure you have class selected and then let's add in externalDB app. Now to turn this class into an IexternalDB application, let's inherit from IexternalDBapplication. Currently, that class is outside of the scope for our class, so let's click the light bulb, select using autodesk.revit.DB. It's throwing another error because we need to implement the on start up and on shut down methods. So clicking the light bulb again and let's select implement interface. Now within the on start up and on shut down methods is where we can subscribe and unsubscribe events to that are exposed in the API. Events are notifications that are triggered when a specific action occurs in the UI or API. By subscribing to these events, we can execute specific methods when the events occur. This is done through the controlled application that is passed to the method when it's executed. This provides access to events that occur at an application project level. Such as a document opening, saving or synchronizing, for example. Let's subscribe to the document changed event. We can use this to notify us when a piece of furniture is modified. To do this, we'll need to create an event handler method that takes the center object and document changed events arguments as the parameters. So let's start by creating our event handler method below the on start up method. This will be a public method which won't return anything. Let's add public void and then let's call this event handler method element changed event. The parameters for this method will be those required by the document changed event, which are object, sender. This will be the document in which the event occurs and second, we'll need a document changed event args objects which we'll call args. To access this class, we'll need to add the using autodesk.revit.DV.events name space into our class. The event arguments object is sent to the method when the event occurs and it provides methods to access the elements associated with the event. One of these is the get modified elements ID method which takes an element filter. We can use this filter to look for specific elements that have changed in the document. So let's start by creating this filter within our method. To do this, let's add an element filter, which we'll call filter, and this will be a new element category filter searching for built in category type OST_furniture. So we can use this filter to find any furniture elements that have changed in the document. So let's use this filter with the get modified element IDs method. This exercise, I'll just be retrieving the first element ID that changes. So let's create an element ID variable named element. We'll assign to this a call to get modified element IDs found in the args variable, with our filter as a parameter. Then let's follow this with the first extension method. If you wanted to get all the furniture elements that have changed, you would need a list of element IDs rather than a single element ID. I'm going to keep this simple however. To know what happened to the element, let's retrieve the transaction name that occurred when the document changed. To do that, let's create a string variable named name and we'll assign to this a call to the get transaction names method found in the arguments object. So args.gettransactionnames, and from this, let's retrieve the first one. Perfect, so we now have the name of the transaction, let's display it as a task dialogue back to the user. To do that, let's access the task dialogue class. Currently, this isn't referenced into a class, so let's add the using autodesk.revit.UI statement and now we can access the show method. For the title of our dialogue, let's call it modified element. And next, let's add in the string to show to the user. Let's start with the element ID that's changed. As we've already got that stored under element, let's add in element.tostring, and then we'll add the string, changed by, and then add again, and then let's add in the transaction name which is name in our case. Great, so we now have an event handler method, which we can use to subscribe to the document changed event and it will tell us the first piece of furniture that is changed in the document.
