Customizing the user interface
- [Instructor] Now that we have implemented the IExternalApplication interface let's go ahead and start customizing the UI. I currently have the Visual Studio exercise file open for this video. This is where we left off from the last video. We've implemented the OnShutdown and OnStartup methods. However, both of these are currently throwing acceptions. So let's start by fixing these up. The Onshutdown method will be called when Revit is shutting down. As we don't really need anything to occur in this event, let's simply return a successful result. So return Result.Succeeded. In the Onstartup method is where we can create a new ribbon element. So, let's start by removing the acception and adding the new ribbon element. To do that we need to access the UIControlledApplication object that is passed to the method when Revit boots up. So, let's access application, and then from within here we can add a tab by using the CreateRibbonTab method. This simply takes a string for the name for the new tab. I'm going to call mine My Commands. Awesome, so that's all it takes to make our new panel in the UI. Let's make it a little bit more exciting by adding a button. To do that we first need to create a button using the PushButtonData class which has a SingleConstructor method. So, let's create a PushButtonData variable named button and we'll assign to this a new PushButtonData object. This takes all string parameters. These are the name of the button, the text name shown for the button, the assembly that contains the button command and the class name for the button. So what this means is we can connect the button to external commands that we have created. Rather than having them live in the external tools menu they can be placed within our new tab. So, let's add a button that will execute the PlaceFamily command that we created in an earlier video. Let's start with a button name. I'm simply going to call mine Button1. Next, we need the visible name for the button. Let's make this a little bit more exciting. I'm going to call mine PlaceFamily. Then we need the assembly. This is the .dll file from which our command will be executing. In our case, this is the same assembly from which we are executing this method. So we can access this executing assembly by accessing the GetExecutingAssembly method from the assembly class found in the System.Reflection name space. So at the top let's add in using System.Reflection. Now, before our button is created let's create a new string variable named path and we'll assign to this a call to the GetExecutingAssembly from the assembly class. This returns an assembly object. To get the file path we then need to access the location property, great. Now let's use this path variable in our PushButtonData constructor method. After PlaceFamily let's simply add path. Next we need the full class name for the executing command. So let's use MyRevitCommands.PlaceFamily. As this needs to be a string, let's then surround that with quotation marks, perfect. We now have our button, next we need to add it into a panel that will be placed inside of the tab. The panel is simply a group of commands. To create a panel let's start with a RibbonPanel variable named panel and we'll assign to this a call to the CreateRibbonPanel method from the UIControlledApplication. So, application.CreateRibbonPanel. Next, for the constructor method let's use the one that takes the string for the tab name and a string for the new panel name. So it will be My Commands for the tab, for the panel, let's simply call it Commands. Now we can simply add our button to the panel by using the AddItem method from the panel object. So on a new line let's access panel.AddItem. This requires a RibbonItemData object which our PushButtonData is as it inherits the RibbonItemData class. So let's add in button. Awesome, so we've now created a ribbon, we've added a panel to that ribbon and then we've added our button to that panel. Lastly, we just need to return our result from our method. So, let's return Result.Succeeded, great. As we already have this written into our manifest file let's go ahead and hit start to try our new tab. Open up the Revit exercise file for this video. So you can see there's our new tab if we click that we have our new PlaceFamily command. Let's go to the Ground Floor plan and try the command. Great, so our button is executing our command that we created earlier. Adding commands to buttons is a much cleaner way of grouping custom commands and executing them. As we are referencing the command via the application we don't need to add it as a command to the manifest. So you can imagine how much easier it will be to just add one added entry to the manifest file.
