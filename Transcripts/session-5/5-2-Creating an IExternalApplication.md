Creating an IExternalApplication

- [Instructor] As we have learned in the previous video, we can customize the Revit user interface ribbon by creating an adding class that implements the IExternal Application interface. So in this video, let's start by creating and IExternal Application class that we can use to customize the UI. I've currently got the Visual Studio exercise file open for this video. Within this file, I've added in to the manifest the application type and DB application type. The DB application type is currently commented out. We'll use this in a following video. So let's implement the application type. You can see that it references an external application class. This is the class in which we'll inherit from the IExternal application interface. So, let's start by creating that. Before that though, let's clean up the solution a little bit. Right click the solution name and select Add Folder. Let's call this Commands. We can place all of our commands in here to make it a little bit more organized. To do that, using the Control+Shift buttons and the left click mouse button. Let's select all of our commands. And then move these or drag these into the Commands folder. It'll notify us that this might take a while. Let's just hit okay. Perfect. Now, all of our commands are contained in this commands file. To create our new IExternal application, let's right click the solution, go to Add and then New Item. In here under Visual C# Items, let's select the C# Class and rename this to External Applications. Now, let's turn this class into an IExternal application by simply inheriting the IExternal application interface. We don't have the Revit API referencing here yet. So, let's right click our IExternal Application, select Quick Actions, and then using AutoDesk.Revit.UI. Perfect. We now have the library referenced in. Next, let's right click it again, Quick Actions, and this time select Implement Interface. Great, so we now have the OnShutDown and OnStartUp methods. We can add our code into these to start customizing the user interface.
