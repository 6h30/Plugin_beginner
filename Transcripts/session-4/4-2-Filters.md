Filters
- [Instructor] Filters can be applied, using the parameter filter element class or selection filter element class. Selection filter element class is used to apply filters to a group of selected elements. However, the parameter filter element class is rule based, that means we can filter by parameter rules. As we want to filter for the view name of sections, let's use the parameter filter element class. This has three different constructive methods. One will filter the categories, the second for categories and then element filter and the last for categories and a list of filter rules. We just want one rule. So let's use the one that takes an element filter. The categories we can use the section category to collect all the sections in a view. For the rule, we need to create an element parameter filter object, this allows us to apply filters to elements. The element parameter filter object can be created with constructive methods. The first of which simply takes a filter rule. This is the filter rule that'll be used to filter the elements that pass through. To construct a filter rule, we need to access the parameter filter rule factory. This contains a series of different methods that create different filter rules. One of these is the create contains rule, this will check if a string, in a given parameter, contains a certain value. In our case this will be WIP. So let's use this in conjunction with the parameter element filter class, to filter the document for sections, and then check if the name contains the string WIP. I've currently got the visual studio exercise file open for this video. In here is a class code G filter, which is another add in external command. I've started by retrieving the document, and then setting up a transaction. So to start, let's get the parameters that we'll need for our parameter filter element object. The first will be, the categories that we want to filter for. We need a list of categories. So let's start by creating a list, containing element ID's. We'll call that cats. And then we can just simply add a category to that list. So, cats .add and as you can see, we need an element ID. We can retrieve that by using the element ID constructor. So new element ID and then we can pass it by building category. So let's pass the building category, OST, and the score sections. Great, so now that we have these sections category, let's create our filter. To do that, we need an element parameter filter variable, which we'll call filter. We'll then assign to this a new element parameter filter, and then the filter rule that we want to apply. As we just learned, we can create a filter rule by accessing the parameter filter rule factory. And then from within here, we can use the create contains rule. This takes an element ID, which is the parameter that we're filtering for it then takes a string, which is the value we're looking for in that parameter, and then I'm going to check if it's case sensitive or not. So for the parameter, let's use the element ID constructor again. This time we'll pass it and built in parameter, which will be view_name. For the value, let's add the string WIP, and for the case sensitive, let's say false. So now that we have a list containing our category, and a filter, we can create the parameter filter element. Let's do that within the transaction, as we'll be modifying the document. Within here let's create a new parameter filter element, and we'll call it filter element, and then we'll assign to this a call to the create method, from the parameter filter element class. This takes the document, the name for our filter. So let's call it, my first filter. Next we need our list of categories, in our case that will be cats. And lastly, our element filter, which will be filter. Awesome, so now we need to apply this to our view. And we can do that by using the add filter method, in our view object. To keep this simple, let's use the active view in the document. We can access this from the document variable doc. And then call the add filter method, and apply our filter element. You can see it's gone red because we need to provide an element ID. So let's simply access the ID property from our filter element. Perfect. We then need to set the visibility of these filtered elements, by using the set filter visibility method from the same active view. So doc active view, set filter visibility, and here we need to pass our same filter, so let's add in filter element.ID and then the visibility. To hide them, we need to set this to false. Perfect. So our command will create a filter, that elements of the section category, that have the string WIP contained in the name. I've already gone ahead and added this command into the manifest file. So let's go ahead and hit start to debug. Then open up the Revit exercise file for this video. In here you can see that I've rushed ahead, and I've created four different sections. Two of these contain WIP in the names. So let's test our command to see if these get hidden. Go ahead and click view filter. Perfect, it looks like it's worked as expected. To check, let's have a look at the filters, in the filter overrides menu. Go ahead and click V V. And then in the filters tab, we have my first filter. As you know there are many ways to create dynamic filters in Revit. Doing this directly in the Revit API, offers huger ways to automate work files, by applying and setting filters automatically.
