Modifying elements
- [Narrator] We now have a command in our project file that has started a transaction. Let's use this to modify the document by learning how to delete an element. To start, in the object browser, let's search for delete. Perfect, so it looks like the first method is the delete method from the document class. If you can't see this, make sure the settings of the browser includes show inherited members. This method simply takes an element ID, which is the element to be deleted. So let's use this in our command. And we'll do this after the transaction has started. To access the delete method let's access the document, and here we can find delete. Then for the element ID, we can retrieve this from the selected element as we have done in previous videos. By accessing the element ID property from the picked object. Perfect. So the element will delete, but not until the transaction has been committed. To ensure the user is confident they want to delete the method, let's create a task dialogue that takes user input to double check they want to delete it. To do that let's start by creating a task dialogue object by using the variable, T dialogue. And this time we'll construct it with a single string as the parameter, which will be the name. So, delete element. This is a different way that we have been doing, so far to create task dialogues, but it allows us to set the properties of the task dialogue before we show it. So to start, let's change the contents of the dialogue. That is, what it will display. We can do that by setting the main content property. And let's set it to a string, such as, are you sure you want to delete the element. We then need buttons to confirm whether or not to delete the element. To do this we need to access the common buttons property on the task dialogue. And then assign it two button enumerations, separated by a special task dialogue operator which is the bar symbol. So let's add the okay button, first, by accessing the task dialogue common buttons enumeration. Then separate this with a bar symbol, and then the next button which will be cancel. So the bar symbol here, simply separates the two buttons and allows the task dialogue object to identify which is on the left, the okay button, and which is on the right, the cancel button. Now we can display our task dialogue. To do that, let's call the task dialogue show method inside of an if statement. By doing this we can immediately check the task dialogue result. If the result is the unknown okay, then we can go ahead and commit the transaction. And otherwise, roll it back. So let's check if the task dialogue dot show result is equal to the okay unknown. Then, inside of the if statement, let's commit the transaction with the commit method from the transaction object. And now we want to display this back to the user. So let's show another task dialogue using the show method directly from the task dialogue class. Let's call it delete and we want this to simply show if the element ID was deleted. Let's access the element ID from the picked object, using the two string method. And then we'll add to this the string deleted. Now let's add an else statement to catch if the user hit cancel. If this happens we want to roll back the delete. And we can do this by simply calling the roll back method from the transaction object. And to relay this back to the user, let's copy and paste the same task dialogue we just made and we'll change it to not deleted. So we have now implemented a transaction to delete an element that has been selected, and use the task dialogue to confirm the deletion to keep it saved. I've already gone ahead and added this into the add in file with the command named, delete element. So let's hit the debug button and test this out. And to try this, I'm simply going to create a new file, and I'll try the new command on a section. Great, there's our box. Let's hit okay. Perfect. The element's being deleted. We've successfully made a change to the model. We will continue to use transactions throughout the course. As they required if any changes are made to the model. The key thing to remember, is if you open a transaction make sure to close it.
