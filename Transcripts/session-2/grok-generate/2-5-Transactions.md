Transactions

- So far in the course we have used the Revit API to access elements and data from the Revit model although we haven't made any actual changes to the model. To do this we will need to learn about Revit transactions. Any changes that are made to the Revit model need to be encapsulated inside of an active transaction otherwise an exception will be thrown. We can create a transaction by using the transaction class. The transaction class, once instantiated, offers a few different methods to control a transaction. These are Start, Commit and Rollback. Start allows us to start a transaction, Commit commits any changes to the model and Rollback reverts any changes to before the transaction. Once an active transaction is committed the changes made inside the transaction become part of the model. It is important to note here that only one transaction can be active at one time. It is also important to enclose a transaction within a using or try-catch statement to ensure the transaction does not unintentionally stay active. So using this transaction class let's create a command that modifies the document. As you can see I've got the Visual Studio project file open for this video. I have simply gone ahead and created a new command called DeleteElement as we'll be creating a command that allows us to simply delete an element. Inside of this command I have already retrieved the UI document Document and created a try-catch statement to allow us to pick an object. The first thing we need to do is change the attribute of this command as we want it to be Manual, not ReadOnly. This will allow us to create transactions, much like our GetElementid command, this command will allow us to pick an object and then check if the element is picked. So inside of the if statement let's add a transaction. To do that let's enclose the transaction within a using statement by writing using. Then within the parentheses, let's create a transaction object using the variable trans. And for the parameters it requires the document and the name of the transaction. Let's call it Delete Element. The name here will show in the undo menu. Within this using statement is where we can start a transaction. So to do that we simply call the Start method from the trans object and this takes no parameters, perfect. Our command is now ready to start making changes to the model.
