- [Instructor] Using the Revit API, we can filter for elements in a Revit project by creating what's known as a filtered element collector and applying different filters to it. A FilteredElementCollector object, when created, is created to search through all elements in a project. A FilteredElementCollector can be constructed in three different ways: by searching the entire Revit document, searching through a specific set of elements, or searching a specific view. Once a filtered element collector has collected all the elements in one of these different ways, we then need to apply a filter to reduce the element set we are searching. In fact, when creating a filtered element collector, it requires at least one filter before we can start accessing the elements. As an element passes through the collector, the filter is used to check if it meets certain criteria, depending on what the filter is. For example, checking if an element is of a certain category or family type. There are three types of filters we can use: quick, slow, and logical. And when we apply these filters, we can retrieve the filtered elements. A quick filter is any filter that inherits from the ElementQuickFilter class. They are understandably the quickest filters, as it only checks basic element information. Shortcut methods are available from the filtered element collector for the most used ones, such as a category filter, which will filter for elements of a specific category, or OfClass, which will find elements of a particular class. A slow filter inherits from the ElementSlowFilter class, and takes a more detailed look at elements as they pass through the filter, which is why it tends to be a bit slower. Slow filters tend to work best when combined with a quick filter. So the quick filter filters for the category first, for example, and then the slow filter filters those elements for a particular level. Logical filters derive from the element logical filter class, which includes types LogicalAndFilter and the LogicalOrFilter. These work like logical operators work, in that we can combine filters of quick and slow to filter for elements. There are a few different ways that we can apply filters. To apply a single filter, we use the method WherePasses on the FilteredElementCollector object, with the filter as the input parameter. We can also use the shortcut methods, which are described in the FilteredElementCollector class. For example, OfCategory, or OfClass. And we can also apply multiple filters by using shortcuts with WherePasses, or combining filters using the logical filters. Once we have applied our filters, we need to retrieve the items from the collector. A few ways that this can be done is by using the methods ToElements, FirstElement, ToElementIds, and FirstElementId. And these are used to retrieve either the elements or element IDs from the collector, depending on how you need them. These methods can be found within the FilteredElementCollector object.
