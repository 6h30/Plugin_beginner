Retrieving element information

- [Instructor] So far we have learned about the different ways that we can classify an element and how to retrieve an element from its element ID. Now that we have a reference to an element from the last video let's have a look at the element class in the object browser to find out about the different ways that we can access its information. Including its category name, family name, family symbol name and the instance name. In the object browser let's go ahead and search for element. Within the element class, we can quite easily get the category name by accessing the category property from the object. We can also get the instance name by simply accessing the name property from the element object. To get the family name and the family symbol name is a little bit trickier. To do that we'll need to retrieve the element type object that defines the instance, that is, the family symbol. To retrieve this, we'll need to call the 'get type ID' method from the element class. The get type ID method will return the element ID of the element type. So let's have a look at the element type class. Within this class from which the family symbol derives from, there are two properties; the name and the family name properties. The name property will return the name of the family symbol and the family name property will return the name of the family name. So let's jump back into our code and use these in our command. As you can probably tell I'm currently in the visual studio, project file that we ended from in the last video. So if you don't have this open you can find it in the exercise folder for this video. After line 31 where we retrieve the element, let's go ahead and retrieve the element type. To do that, let's create an element ID variable named E type ID. And we'll assign to this a code to the get type ID method from the element object. And this takes no parameters. Now we can use the get element method again from the document, although this time we'll use the element ID we just retrieved. And as we want the element type we'll need to cast it as a element type object. We can do this by using the AS keyword. The AS keyword is a safe way to cast as if it fails it won't raise an exception, it will just simply return null. As the element type derives from the element class, we can safely cast from the base class to the derive class of element type. So let's create and element type variable named eType and then use the it element method from the document with eType I'd as the parameter. And this has caused an error in the code because we need to cast it as element type. Perfect. So now we have a reference to both the element and the element type that was used to create the element. So let's retrieve some of the information from these objects to see all the different classifications. To do this let's simply re use the task dialogue that we created earlier. Let's rename it to element classification. And to start let's simply display the element ID by using the two string method from the element ID. Then, to add a new line to our dialogue, let's use the new line property from the environment class in the system names first. This is useful for working with strings and it basically adds a new line. To use this, let's use the add symbol and then access the environment class dot new line. We can use this class because the system names base is already referenced into our class. Then on the next line, let's extract the category from the element. First use the plus symbol, now we want to concatenate the string category so we know that we know what we're retrieving and colon space. And then we can simply get the category name by accessing the category property from the element and from this category element we can access its name. And let's add another new line. And next, let's display the instance name, we can do that by simply retrieving the name from the element. Next, let's retrieve the family symbol name. We can retrieve this by accessing the name property from the element type object. And finally let's get the family name by accessing the family name property from the element type object. Perfect. So let's check if this has worked by hitting the debug command. Now go ahead and start a new project and let's test the command on a section. Perfect. So it looks like it's worked as expected. You can see that we've got the element ID to start followed by the string category and then the category that it belongs to and then the instance name which is section one, the symbol name which is building section and the family name which is section. Using these classifications enables us to find and select different elements in the project file as well as specify which elements we want to create or manipulate. We'll be using these different classifications throughout the course. In areas such as filtering for elements.
