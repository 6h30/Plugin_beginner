Parameter values
- [Instructor] We now know how to get parameter information such as its name, unit type, and built-in parameter. Using what we know, let's now have a look at getting and setting parameter values. I currently have the Visual Studio exercise file open for this video. In here, I've created a new command called SetParameter. This is similar to the GetParameter command; however, I've removed the area where we got the parameter and I've added in a using statement to set a parameter. First, let's get the parameter using its built-in parameter. Retrieving parameters this way is much more stable as parameters won't contain two of the same built-in parameter, which can sometimes happen with the Lookup method. So let's create a new parameter variable called param and we'll assign to this a call from the element class to get_Parameter, using the built-in parameter INSTANCE_HEAD_HEIGHT. You might be wondering why we had to prefix the property with get. This is because it is called an index property. Index properties allow for properties to be retrieved like a method which will impact the return value. These overloaded properties need to be prefixed by get or set_. Now that we have the parameter, let's display the storage type and the value of the parameter. The storage type is the value type it holds, so boolean string or double, for example. We then need to use the specific method associated with the type to retrieve it. So let's create another task dialog named Parameter Values. And using the string.Format method. let's display the information. Let's show the parameter storage type and value. The first argument will be the param.StorageType and then ToString, as the storage type is a type of enumeration. To retrieve the parameter value, let's use the AsDouble method from the parameter object as I know ahead of time that the HEAD_HEIGHT parameter stores a double. If this is unknown and you happen to guess, it will cause an error if the type is not a double. It may be a string or boolean, for example, in which the AsString or AsDouble methods can be used. So let's go ahead and hit Debug to see what we get. And then open up the Revit exercise file and try our new command. Right, so we can see that the storage type is in fact a double and the value is 7.00. This is displaying in feet as the core unit type of the Revit engine is in feet. So based on this information, let's set the parameter. To do that, we can use a simple Set method from the parameter object, which is used to basically set parameter values. As I've already created the transaction and Start and Commit methods, let's access the Set method from the parameter. You will notice two Set methods: the Set method and SetValueString. This is used to set a number which is displayed in its units, such as feet. We just need the Set method, though, so let's select that. And then for the value, let's add 7.5 for 7.5 feet. Then go ahead and Debug the command again and open up the Revit exercise file, then let's switch to 3D view to see if it affects the window. Let's go to the Add-Ins, External Tools, SetParameter. There, we can see the original GetParameter values. Let's close that. Perfect, you can see the window updated. Having the ability to get and set parameters in the Revit API is very useful for updating many parameters at once or extracting data from elements. It is always safe, however, to check and ensure you are setting the correct parameter value type, as this can cause errors if not done correctly.
